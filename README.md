## Project Overview
A comprehensive geomorphological characterization of the Kali Sub-basin (1175.45 km²) to understand hydrological behavior and erosional stages. This methodology is directly applicable to terrestrial and planetary fluvial systems.



## Quantitative Parameters Calculated:
* **Linear Aspects:** Stream Order (7th order basin), Bifurcation Ratio (Mean Rb: 4.67).
* **Aerial Aspects:** Drainage Density (2.853 km/km²), Circularity Ratio, Stream Frequency.
* **Relief Aspects:** Basin Relief, Ruggedness Number, Hypsometric Integral.

## Technical Highlights
* **Automated Drainage Extraction:** Used Hydrology Toolboxes to identify a dendritic drainage pattern.
* **Tectonic Implications:** Analysis of bifurcation ratios to identify areas with structural/geologic control.
